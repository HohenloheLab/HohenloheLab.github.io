		    <p>The goal of my graduate research is to understand the role of genetic variation in the adaptation of nonmodel species 
		    to novel environments.  Before joining the Hohenlohe lab in fall 2015, I worked for the Colorado Department of Agriculture 
		    in the monitoring of the tamarisk leaf beetle (<i>Diorhabda</i> spp.) introduced to control the invasive shrub tamarisk 
		    (<i>Tamarix</i> spp.), and for the international organization CABI in testing the host range of several weevils in the 
		    <i>Ceutorhynchus</i> genus for the control targets garlic mustard ((i>Alliaria petiolata</i>) and perennial pepperweed 
		    (<i>Lepidium latifolium</i>).  I plan to apply genomic tools in several biological control systems to test establishment and 
		    range expansion hypotheses, especially regarding the interactions of founder effects, hybridization, and selection 
		    where these agents are recently introduced in North America.</p>
