					<br>As a molecular ecologist, I use advanced genomics techniques to understand the threats 
					to global biodiversity and to promote ecosystem conservation. Broadly, I am interested in 
					the adaptive significance of phenotypic variation in small, isolated, and declining 
					populations, particularly with regards to disease susceptibility/resistance. My 
					dissertation will focus on the effects of disease-induced selective pressures on 
					underlying genetic patterns in two endangered species: the Tasmanian Devil 
					(Sarcophilus harrisii) and the Catalina Island Fox (Urocyon littoralis catalinae). 
					To understand these evolutionary dynamics, I plan to use a variety of techniques 
					ranging from RAD sequencing and transcriptomics. These two systems provide a unique 
					opportunity to explore techniques in genetic mining of deleterious mutations, as well 
					as to answer questions about the genetic consequences of population bottlenecks overtime. 
					I hope my findings will help guide future management actions to ensure the survival of 
					these species threatened with cancer. Before entering this PhD program, I studied the 
					cryptic population structure of red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) along the Pacific coast, 
					and the genetic continuity of modern and historic wolves along the western United States, 
					which directly contributed to wildlife conservation and management as well as informed local 
					law enforcement efforts. I received my masterâ€™s degree at San Francisco State University, 
					where my thesis work focused on the coevolution of parasitic quill mites and their avian 
					hosts and aided in the discovery of several species previously unknown to science.</p>

					The goal of my graduate research is to understand the role of genetic variation in the
					adaptation of nonmodel species to novel environments.  Before joining the Hohenlohe lab 
					in Fall 2015, I worked for the Colorado Department of Agriculture in the monitoring 
					of the tamarisk leaf beetle (Diorhabda spp.) introduced to control the invasive shrub 
					tamarisk (Tamarix spp.), and for the international organization CABI in testing the 
					host range of several weevils in the Ceutorhynchus genus for the control targets 
					garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata) and perennial pepperweed (Lepidium latifolium).  
					I plan to apply genomic tools in several biological control systems to test 
					establishment and range expansion hypotheses, especially regarding the interactions of 
					founder effects, hybridization, and selection where these agents are recently introduced 
					in North America.</p>
