						<h2>Population Genetics</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Our lab studies a wide range of questions in population genetics and genomics, including adaptation, population structure and 
					phylogeography, disease resistance, the genetic basis of complex phenotypes, hybridization, and demographic reconstruction.  We use a common 
					set of molecular techniques such as Restriction site-Associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) and whole-genome sequencing, 
					combined with computational and bioinformatic tools, along with mathematical modeling rooted in population genetics and 
					quantitative genetics theory.</p>

						<h2>Conservation Genomics</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Genomic tools have revolutionized biology and have powerful applications to conservation of species and ecosystems.  
					Much of our population genomics work has applications to conservation. Ongoing projects include
					adaptation and genetic diversity in isolated bulltrout populations, microgeographic adaptation in island scrub jays, 
					genetic rescue in Columbia Basin pygmy rabbits, hybridization and adaptive capacity in trout populations, and many more.</p>
